### Data Storage
to store information, I used [useReducer](https://uk.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) instead of useState for more convenient development and optimization code

### Design

In order for everything to look neat and beautiful. \
I used UI components from [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/)

### API 
[Free Currency Rates API](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/currency-api#readme) helped me get all data that i needed. \
For request i used [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) and own useFetching hook
